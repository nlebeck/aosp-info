# AOSP Info

During grad school, I worked on a project that involved making extensive modifications to the Android Runtime (ART). I learned a lot about the inner workings of ART and also about how to compile the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) codebase and deploy it onto a device. I created this repository to share some of what I learned.

Everything I write here comes with the major caveat that I don't necessarily know what I'm talking about. Please do not take this information as authoritative in any way. Following my instructions for compiling and deploying AOSP may result in rendering your device permanently unusable (although for what it's worth, I haven't yet managed to hard-brick a Pixel XL).

Furthermore, these pages are based on my experiences modifying and running AOSP version 7.1.1 on a Pixel XL. I'm not sure how much AOSP has changed since version 7.1.1, but my hope is that there are enough broad similarities to make this information useful even if you're working with later versions or different devices.

This repo currently has the following pages:
